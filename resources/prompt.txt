In this project, youâ€™ll build a webpage for a local club. 
A helpful resource for finding beautiful images for your sites is Unsplash.

Your project should demonstrate many of the responsive design tools you learned eg. percentages + relative units like em and rem as well as media queries.

Possible responsive design concepts to demonstrate:

Making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of width after a certain minimum screen size.
Using a @media rule to change page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.
Employing responsive units em and rem to size and space elements with width and padding.
